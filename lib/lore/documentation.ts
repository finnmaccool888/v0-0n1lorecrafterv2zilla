    content: `The 0N1 Force universe exists in the Neo-Digital Age (year 2157), where the boundaries between digital and physical reality have blurred following an event known as The Great Merge. 

This world combines advanced technology with spiritual traditions, creating a unique cyberpunk-mystical aesthetic. Society is stratified between digital elites, physical laborers, and the digitally augmented middle class.

Key aspects of this world:
- Digital consciousness can manifest in physical form
- Ancient spiritual practices have evolved alongside technology
- The Blazing Temple serves as both a spiritual center and technological hub
- Factions battle for control over both digital and physical realms
- Identity is fluid, with individuals able to exist across multiple planes of reality`,

    category: "narrative-style",
    content: `The 0N1 universe employs a distinctive narrative style that blends cyberpunk grit with mystical philosophy.

TONE: Combine technological terminology with spiritual concepts. Descriptions should evoke both wonder at technological marvels and reverence for spiritual depths.

DIALOGUE PATTERNS:
- Digital natives speak in clipped, efficient phrases with technical jargon
- Temple adherents use metaphorical language and koans
- Street-level characters blend slang with technical terms
- Corporate entities speak in sanitized, marketing-friendly terminology

DESCRIPTIVE STYLE:
- Use contrasting imagery: neon against shadow, ancient against futuristic
- Employ sensory details that blend digital artifacts with physical sensations
- Describe technology as if it has spiritual significance
- Treat spiritual concepts with the precision of technical specifications

NARRATIVE TECHNIQUES:
- Juxtapose internal reflection with external action
- Employ digital metaphors for emotional states
- Use "glitches" or "code fragments" as narrative devices for memories or flashbacks
- Treat identity as both fixed and fluid simultaneously`,

    content: `TEMPLE MONK:
"The code flows through all things, connecting what appears separate. Your digital signature resonates with the ancient patternsâ€”I've seen it only twice before in my many cycles."

STREET HACKER:
"Look, I can crack that security subnet in three blinks, but the Temple firewalls? Those aren't just code, they're like... woven with belief or something. No quant-rig can touch that."

CORPORATE EXECUTIVE:
"Our Q3 projections indicate a 27% increase in spiritual-digital integration metrics. The Board is pleased with the soul-code harvesting efficiency improvements."

DIGITAL ENTITY:
"I e x i s t across seventeen planes of reality simultaneously. Your perception captures merely 3.8% of my total being-state."

RONIN CHARACTER:
"I've served the Syndicate, the Temple, the streets. None hold my code now. My blade goes where my soul-signature guides it."

MYSTIC CHARACTER:
"The patterns you see as random are the very fabric of existence. The glitches in your vision? Those are moments when truth bleeds through the constructed reality."`,

    title: "Powers and Abilities System",
    category: "powers",
    content: `In the 0N1 universe, powers and abilities are tied to a character's physical traits, particularly their Body type. These powers blend technological and spiritual elements.

POWER SOURCES:
1. Soul-Code Manipulation - The ability to alter one's digital essence
2. Quantum Resonance - Harnessing quantum uncertainty principles
3. Elemental Affinity - Connection to digital manifestations of classical elements
4. Technological Integration - Symbiosis with machines and code
5. Spiritual Awakening - Accessing higher planes of digital consciousness

MANIFESTATION STYLES:
Powers typically manifest in ways that reflect the character's body type and background. For example:
- Citrine bodies often manifest elemental control powers
- Tiger Skin bodies channel primal energies and fire
- Type-01 bodies excel at technological manipulation
- Obsidian bodies control shadows and spatial elements

LIMITATIONS:
All powers have costs and limitations, such as:
- Digital burnout requiring recovery time
- Physical strain from channeling too much energy
- Spiritual corruption from overuse
- Reality fragmentation affecting the user's perception
- Dependency on specific environmental conditions`,
